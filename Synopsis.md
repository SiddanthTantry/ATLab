# Digital Image Cryptography
## Project overview
The need to secure and reliable means of communication containing images and videos  have become  extremely  necessary. Accordingly, network security and data encryption issues are considered as a significant subject.  Currently, images are considered as the most important source of information.  The applications of image and video encryption can be used in various fields like wireless communication,  multimedia  systems,  medical imaging, telemedicine, and military communication. The secret image can be sent to the intended person, and at the other end the person can decrypt the secret image to get the original image.
## Problem definition
The popularity of digital images has increased security problems in storing or transmitting vital images. Secret image sharing techniques preserve image securely by sharing secret image among shared images and then recovering the secret image from shared images.
There are many algorithms for image cryptography which have different performances for different set of images. We will be comparing the algorithms based on their processing time and dataset. The output of the different algorithms is compared according to dataset specific and algorithm specific. 
 
## Objectives
Cryptography aims to compare the algorithms with respect to different aspects such as time taken to encrypt and decrypt the image.
## Scope
By doing comparative analysis of the image cryptography algorithms we will come to know which algorithm is best for a given dataset and vice versa. And also when doing further research this comparative study will be useful for selecting the algorithms to work for specific type of dataset.
